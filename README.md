An LTD controller operation

1. At the beginning, the heater will be turned on to warm the dry room. When the temperature inside the dry room reaches a user-defined maximum temperature value, the heater will be stopped.

2. When the heater is on, the fan2 will be on as well to make the temperature of the air be evenly distributed in the dry room.

3. If the humidity inside the dry room is greater than a user-defined maximum humidity, the fan1 will be turned on to transfer the humidity air from the dry room to the outside. We can control the speed of the fan1. For example, when the humidity is about 90% or more, the fan1 will run in full speed. When 80%, the fan will run at 80% of the full speed and so on.

4. When the heat pump is on, the fan 3 is also on to help the heat pump work better.

5. Please note that when the heater is on, the heat pump is off and vice versa.

6. The user can set the timer so that the heater and heat pump can be turned on periodically.

7. The controller should add time out for each operation.

8. The controller should have at least three humidity sensors and three temperature sensors for reliability operations.
